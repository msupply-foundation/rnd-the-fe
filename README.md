### Stocktake page

If I (Andrei) was implementing it, I would go step by step, measure performance stats and observing what updates when

* Create basic table
* graphql/codegen
* Filter
* Filter in url parameter
* Add checkbox on each row and delete button, delete button deletes selected row
* Add modal for editings stock lines
* After edits in modal table updates


### Examples of things/areas, as an alternative

* Auth and shell, how it's gated and routed, including initialisation (use this PR)
* Lighter version of JSON forms
* How to use AI for performance tests/evaluation
* Design pattern <-> implementations (how to keep those in sync, leverage AI)
* Plugins with vite
